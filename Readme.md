# `PART I` — Hardware & Setup

## 1. Hardware Overview

The AMD BC-250 is a custom APU originally designed for Samsung's blockchain/distributed-ledger rack appliances (not a traditional "mining GPU"). It's a full SoC — Zen 2 CPU and Cyan Skillfish RDNA 1.5 GPU on a single package, with 16 GB of on-package unified memory. Samsung deployed these in rack-mount enclosures for private DLT workloads; decommissioned boards now sell for ~$100–150 on the secondhand market, making them an affordable option for running 14B LLMs on dedicated hardware.

<details>
<summary><b>▸ Origin story — Samsung, 5G operators, and AliExpress</b></summary>

**What it was built for:** Samsung commissioned these custom AMD SoCs to build rack-mount servers for **private DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) infrastructure** — not public cryptocurrency mining. The target customers were **South Korean 5G operators** (SK Telecom and others), who were early adopters of 5G deployment. Private blockchain solved several real problems for 5G telcos:

- **IoT microtransactions:** 5G networks connect millions of smart devices. DLT enables cheap, instant machine-to-machine contract settlement without overloading central databases.
- **Digital identity & security:** Operators used DLT registries for cryptographic customer authentication and digital identity wallets (e.g. Samsung Pay integration).
- **Inter-operator settlement:** Blockchain streamlined real-time roaming fee reconciliation and data exchange between telecom partners.

**Who made the hardware:** The SoC was designed by **AMD** (Zen 2 CPU + RDNA 1.5 GPU). Samsung designed the overall system and wrote the factory BIOS. The physical boards were manufactured by **ASRock Rack** (ASRock's server division) as an OEM contractor — Samsung rack enclosures typically held 12 BC-250 boards each. ASRock Rack is known for producing highly custom designs for large tech companies.

**How they ended up on AliExpress:** Classic corporate e-waste cycle. As 5G infrastructure evolved, entire Korean server racks were decommissioned. Specialized recycling centers (mostly near Shenzhen, China) buy pallets of retired servers in bulk — often by weight. Workers disassemble the racks, test individual boards, and list working BC-250 modules on AliExpress as all-in-one SBC platforms for $100–150.

</details>

> **Not a PlayStation 5.** Despite superficial similarities (both use Zen 2 + 16 GB memory), the BC-250 has nothing to do with the PS5. The PS5's Oberon SoC is **RDNA 2** (GFX10.3, gfx1030+); the BC-250's Cyan Skillfish is **RDNA 1.5** (GFX10.1, gfx1013) — a hybrid architecture: GFX10.1 instruction set (RDNA 1) but with **hardware ray tracing support** (full `VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline`, `VK_KHR_acceleration_structure`, `VK_KHR_ray_query`). LLVM's AMDGPU processor table lists GFX1013 as product "TBA" under GFX10.1, confirming it was never a retail part. Samsung also licensed RDNA 2 for mobile (Exynos 2200 / Xclipse 920) — that's a completely separate deal.
>
> **Why "RDNA 1.5"?** GFX1013 doesn't fit cleanly into AMD's public RDNA generations. It has the RDNA 1 (GFX10.1) ISA and shader compiler target, but includes hardware ray tracing — a feature AMD only shipped publicly with RDNA 2 (GFX10.3). This makes Cyan Skillfish a transitional/custom design, likely built for Samsung's specific workload requirements. The label "RDNA 1.5" is used here as a practical shorthand.

> **BIOS is not stock.** The board ships with a minimal Samsung BIOS meant for rack operation. A community-patched BIOS (from [AMD BC-250 docs](https://elektricm.github.io/amd-bc250-docs/)) enables standard UEFI features (boot menu, NVMe boot, fan control).

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **CPU** | Zen 2 — 6c/12t @ 2.0 GHz |
| **GPU** | Cyan Skillfish — RDNA 1.5, `GFX1013`, 24 CUs (1536 SPs), ray tracing capable |
| **Memory** | **16 GB unified** (16 × 1 GB on-package), shared CPU/GPU |
| **VRAM** | 512 MB BIOS-carved framebuffer (same physical UMA pool — see note below) |
| **GTT** | **16 GiB** (tuned via `ttm.pages_limit=4194304`, default 7.4 GiB) |
| **Vulkan total** | **16.5 GiB** after tuning |
| **Storage** | 475 GB NVMe |
| **OS** | Fedora 43, kernel 6.18.9, headless |
| **TDP** | 220W board (inference: 130–155W, between jobs: 55–60W, true idle w/o model: ~35W) |
| **BIOS** | Community-patched UEFI (not Samsung stock) — [AMD BC-250 docs](https://elektricm.github.io/amd-bc250-docs/) |
| **CPU governor** | `performance` (stock `schedutil` causes LLM latency spikes) |

### Unified memory is your friend (but needs tuning)

CPU and GPU share the same 16 GB physical pool (UMA — Unified Memory Architecture). The 512 MB "dedicated framebuffer" reported by `mem_info_vram_total` is carved from the *same* physical memory — it's a BIOS reservation, not separate silicon. The rest is accessible as **GTT (Graphics Translation Table)**.

> **UMA reality:** On unified memory, "100% GPU offload" means the model weights and KV cache live in GTT-mapped pages that the GPU accesses directly — there's no PCIe copy. However, it's still the same physical RAM the CPU uses. "Fallback to CPU" on UMA isn't catastrophic like on discrete GPUs (no bus transfer penalty), but GPU ALUs are faster than CPU ALUs for matrix ops.

**Two bottlenecks must be fixed:**

1. **GTT cap** — `amdgpu` driver defaults to 50% of RAM (~7.4 GiB). The legacy fix was `amdgpu.gttsize=14336` in kernel cmdline, but this is no longer needed.
2. **TTM pages_limit** — kernel TTM memory manager independently caps allocations at ~7.4 GiB. Fix: `ttm.pages_limit=4194304` (16 GiB in 4K pages). **This is the only tuning needed.**

> ✅ **GTT migration complete:** `amdgpu.gttsize` was removed from kernel cmdline. With `ttm.pages_limit=4194304` alone, GTT grew from 14→16 GiB and Vulkan available from 14.0→16.5 GiB. The deprecated parameter was actually *limiting* the allocation.

After tuning: Vulkan sees **16.5 GiB** — enough for **14B parameter models at 40K context with Q4_0 KV cache, all inference on GPU**.

---

## 2. Driver & Compute Stack

The BC-250's `GFX1013` sits awkwardly between supported driver tiers.

| Layer | Status | Notes |
|-------|:------:|-------|
| **amdgpu kernel driver** | ✅ | Auto-detected, firmware loaded |
| **Vulkan (RADV/Mesa)** | ✅ | Mesa 25.3.4, Vulkan 1.4.328 |
| **ROCm / HIP** | ❌ | `rocblas_abort()` — GFX1013 not in GPU list |
| **OpenCL (rusticl)** | ❌ | Mesa's rusticl doesn't expose GFX1013 |

**Why ROCm fails:** GFX1013 is listed in LLVM as supporting `rocm-amdhsa`, but AMD's ROCm userspace (rocBLAS/Tensile) doesn't ship GFX1013 solution libraries. **Vulkan is the only viable GPU compute path.**

<details>
<summary>▸ Verification commands</summary>

```bash
vulkaninfo --summary
# → GPU0: AMD BC-250 (RADV GFX1013), Vulkan 1.4.328, INTEGRATED_GPU

cat /sys/class/drm/card1/device/mem_info_vram_total   # → 536870912 (512 MB)
cat /sys/class/drm/card1/device/mem_info_gtt_total    # → 15032385536 (14 GiB)
```

</details>

---

## 3. Ollama + Vulkan Setup

### 3.1 Install and enable Vulkan

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Enable Vulkan backend (disabled by default)
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d/override.conf
[Service]
Environment=OLLAMA_VULKAN=1
Environment=OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=30m
Environment=OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1
Environment=OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1
Environment=OLLAMA_GPU_OVERHEAD=0
Environment=OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=16384
Environment=OLLAMA_MAX_QUEUE=4
OOMScoreAdjust=-1000
EOF
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart ollama
```

> `OOMScoreAdjust=-1000` protects Ollama from the OOM killer — the model process must survive at all costs (see §3.4).

> ROCm will crash during startup — expected and harmless. Ollama catches it and uses Vulkan.

### 3.2 Tune GTT size

> ✅ **No longer needed.** The `amdgpu.gttsize` parameter has been removed. With `ttm.pages_limit=4194304` alone, GTT allocates 16 GiB (more than the old 14 GiB). Verify:

```bash
cat /sys/class/drm/card1/device/mem_info_gtt_total  # → 17179869184 (16 GiB)
# If you still have amdgpu.gttsize in cmdline, remove it:
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args="amdgpu.gttsize=14336"
```

### 3.3 Tune TTM pages_limit ← *unlocks 14B models*

This is the key fix. Without this fix, 14B models load fine but produce HTTP 500 during inference.

```bash
# Runtime (immediate)
echo 4194304 | sudo tee /sys/module/ttm/parameters/pages_limit
echo 4194304 | sudo tee /sys/module/ttm/parameters/page_pool_size

# Persistent
echo "options ttm pages_limit=4194304 page_pool_size=4194304" | \
  sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/ttm-gpu-memory.conf
printf "w /sys/module/ttm/parameters/pages_limit - - - - 4194304\n\
w /sys/module/ttm/parameters/page_pool_size - - - - 4194304\n" | \
  sudo tee /etc/tmpfiles.d/gpu-ttm-memory.conf
sudo dracut -f
```

### 3.4 Context window — the main gotcha

Ollama allocates KV cache based on the model's declared context window. Without a cap, large models request more KV cache than the BC-250 can handle, causing TTM fragmentation, OOM kills, or deadlocks on this UMA system.

**Fix:** Set `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=16384` in the Ollama systemd override (see §3.3). This caps all inference to 16K context by default — matching the MoE primary model's limit.

> Individual requests can override with `{"options": {"num_ctx": 65536}}` when using `qwen3.5:9b` (which handles 65K). The cap only affects the default allocation.

**History of context tuning:**

| Date | Context Cap | Primary Model | Why |
|------|:-----------:|---------------|-----|
| Feb 2026 | 40960 | qwen3:14b | Default — caused deadlocks (TTM fragmentation) |
| Feb 25 | **24576** | qwen3:14b | Sweet spot: ~27 tok/s, 26K was 10% slower, 28K+ deadlocked |
| Mar 14 | **16384** | qwen3.5-35b-a3b MoE | MoE maxes at 16K (KV cache exceeds VRAM at 24K+). 9B fallback can go to 65K per-request. |

> **Why 24K → 16K?** The 35B MoE's total weight (11 GB GGUF) is larger than qwen3:14b (9.3 GB). At 24K+ context the KV cache can't fit alongside the MoE weights. 16K is the maximum stable context for the MoE with all layers on GPU. See §4.3 for detailed KV cache scaling.

### 3.5 Swap — NVMe-backed safety net

With the model consuming 11+ GB on a 14 GB system, disk swap is essential for surviving inference peaks.

> **NVMe wear concern:** Swap is a *safety net*, not an active paging target. In steady state, swap usage is ~400 MB (OS buffers pushed out to make room for model weights). SMART data after months of 24/7 operation: **3% wear, 25.4 TB total written**. The model runs entirely in RAM — swap catches transient spikes during model load/unload transitions. Consumer NVMe drives rated for 300–600 TBW will last years at this rate.

```bash
# Create 16 GB swap file (btrfs requires dd, not fallocate)
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=16384 status=progress
sudo chattr +C /swapfile   # disable btrfs copy-on-write
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon -p 10 /swapfile

# Make permanent
echo '/swapfile none swap sw,pri=10 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

**Disable/reduce zram** — zram compresses pages in *physical* RAM, competing with the model:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf.d
echo -e '[zram0]\nzram-size = 2048' | sudo tee /etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf.d/small.conf
# Or disable entirely: zram-size = 0
```

### 3.6 Verify

```bash
sudo journalctl -u ollama -n 20 | grep total
# → total="11.1 GiB" available="11.1 GiB"  (with qwen3-14b-16k)
free -h
# → Swap: 15Gi total, ~1.4Gi used
```

### 3.7 Disable GUI (saves ~1 GB)

```bash
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target && sudo reboot
```

### 3.8 CPU governor — lock to `performance`

The stock `schedutil` governor down-clocks during idle, causing 50–100ms latency spikes at inference start. Lock all cores to full speed:

```bash
# Runtime (immediate)
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# Persistent (systemd-tmpfiles)
echo 'w /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor - - - - performance' | \
  sudo tee /etc/tmpfiles.d/cpu-governor.conf
```

### Memory layout after tuning

**16 GB Unified Memory**

| Region | Size | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| VRAM carveout | 512 MB | BIOS-reserved from UMA pool (not separate memory) |
| GTT | **16 GiB** | Tuned via `ttm.pages_limit=4194304` (default 7.4 GiB). `amdgpu.gttsize` removed — no longer needed. |
| TTM pages_limit | **16 GiB** | `ttm.pages_limit=4194304` — the only memory tuning parameter needed |

| Vulkan heap | Size |
|-------------|------|
| Device-local | 8.33 GiB |
| Host-visible | 8.17 GiB |
| **Total** | **16.5 GiB** → 14B models fit, all inference on GPU (UMA — same physical pool) |

| Consumer | Usage | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Model weights (qwen3:14b) | 8.2 GiB GPU + 0.4 GiB CPU | Q4_K_M quantization |
| KV cache (FP16 @ 24K) | 3.8 GiB | With Q4_0: only 1.8 GiB for 40K context |
| Compute graph | 0.17 GiB | GPU-side |
| signal-cli + queue-runner | ~1.0 GiB | System RAM |
| OS + services | ~0.9 GiB | Headless Fedora 43 |
| NVMe swap | 16 GiB (374 MB used) | Safety net |
| zram | 0 B (allocated, not active) | Device exists but disksize=0 |
| **Total loaded** | **12.5 GiB** (FP16) / **10.6 GiB** (Q4_0) | **3.9–5.9 GiB free** |

> **All models run 100% on GPU** after GTT tuning (16 GiB). Before the fix, gemma2:9b was only 91% GPU-offloaded (26 tok/s → 38 tok/s after fix).

> ¹ **Why 27B dense fails:** The dense architecture requires all 27B parameters in every forward pass. Without matrix cores (GFX1013 has none), each token requires ~27B multiplications through general-purpose shader cores. Result: 0 tokens generated in 5 minutes. The 35B MoE with only 3B active params per token avoids this entirely — compute is ~9× less per token despite having more total knowledge stored.

> **Prefill column:** Measured at ~400 tokens prompt size (warm model, FP16 KV). Prefill rate depends on prompt length — see §4.5 for detailed sweep. Smaller models (3B) saturate the GPU compute and achieve higher prefill. Larger models (14B) are memory-bandwidth-limited at ~128–137 tok/s. MoE and 9B land between at ~230 tok/s — the MoE benefits from only loading 3B active expert weights per token during prefill. Qwen3-30B-A3B and qwen3.5-27b not measured (deprecated/non-functional).

> **March 14 — Qwen3.5 era:** Ollama upgraded 0.16.1→0.18.0 (required for Qwen3.5). The **qwen3.5-35b-a3b MoE** (35B total, 3B active per token) at IQ2_M quantization is now the primary model on BC-250: 38 tok/s, 233 tok/s prefill, 16K context, multimodal (vision+tools+thinking). The **qwen3.5:9b** provides 65K context with vision when longer documents are needed. Both are Qwen3.5 architecture — a newer generation than Qwen3.

> **⚠️ IQ2_M quality tradeoff:** The extreme quantization (~2.5 bits per parameter) is a significant quality compromise — perplexity increases and complex mathematical reasoning degrades compared to higher-precision quantizations. For everyday tasks (summarization, JSON extraction, tool use, chat) the quality is adequate. For tasks requiring precise reasoning, the `qwen3.5:9b` fallback (Q4_K_M, ~4.5 bits) provides substantially better accuracy. This is an informed tradeoff: more knowledge at lower precision vs less knowledge at higher precision.

**Key insight:** Speed is constant across context sizes with FP16 KV (speed only degrades when the context is actually *filled* — see §4.4). The context ceiling is purely a memory constraint: weights + KV cache + compute graph must fit in 16.5 GiB.

**Graphical benchmarks:**

| Generation Speed | Prefill Speed |

![Generation vs Prefill — all models side by side](images/charts/gen-vs-prefill-all.png)

### 4.3 Context window experiments

The context window directly controls KV cache size, and on 16 GB unified memory, every megabyte counts. After v7 (OpenClaw removal freed ~700 MB, GTT bumped to 14 GB), all context sizes were re-tested systematically:

**Context window vs memory (qwen3:14b Q4_K_M, flash attention, 16 GB GTT)**

| Context | RAM Used | Free | Swap | Speed | Status |
|--------:|---------:|-----:|-----:|------:|--------|
| 8192 | ~9.5 GB | 6.5 GB | — | ~27 t/s | ✅ Safe |
| 12288 | ~10.3 GB | 5.7 GB | — | ~27 t/s | ✅ Conservative |
| 16384 | ~11.1 GB | 4.9 GB | — | ~27 t/s | ✅ Comfortable |
| 18432 | ~13.2 GB | 2.7 GB | 0.9 GB | 26.8 t/s | ✅ Works |
| 20480 | ~13.7 GB | 2.3 GB | 0.9 GB | 26.8 t/s | ✅ Works |
| 22528 | ~14.0 GB | 2.0 GB | 0.9 GB | 26.7 t/s | ✅ Works |
| **24576** | **~14.4 GB** | **1.5 GB** | **0.9 GB** | **26.7 t/s** | **✅ Max for qwen3:14b** |
| 26624 | ~14.6 GB | 1.3 GB | 1.0 GB | 23.9 t/s | ⚠️ 10% slower |
| 28672 | ~14.2 GB | — | 1.7 GB | timeout | ❌ Deadlocks |
| 32768 | ~15.7 GB | 0.2 GB | 2.1 GB | timeout | ❌ Deadlocks |
| 40960 | ~16.0 GB | 0 | — | — | 💀 TTM fragmentation¹ |

> **24K is the sweet spot** — full speed (~27 tok/s), leaves ~1.5 GB for OS/services with stable swap at 0.9 GB. 26K works but inference drops 10% due to swap pressure. 28K+ deadlocks under Vulkan.
>
> ¹ **Why 40K fails isn't raw OOM.** The math: 9.3 GB weights + 2 GB KV cache + 1 GB OS ≈ 12.3 GB < 16 GB available. The actual failure is **TTM fragmentation** — the kernel's TTM memory manager can't allocate a contiguous block large enough for the KV cache because physical pages are fragmented across GPU and CPU consumers. This is a UMA-specific problem: on discrete GPUs with dedicated VRAM, fragmentation doesn't cross the PCIe boundary.

> **History:** The original 24K experiment (Feb 25) deadlocked because OpenClaw gateway consumed ~700 MB. After v7 removed OpenClaw and bumped GTT to 14 GB (Mar 5), 24K became stable. Flash attention (`OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1`) is essential — without it, 24K would not fit.

### 4.4 KV cache quantization — breaking the context ceiling

**UPDATE:** KV cache quantization **WORKS on Vulkan**. Our README previously stated it was a no-op — that was wrong. Tested on Ollama 0.16.1 + RADV Mesa 25.3.4:

| KV Type | 24K ctx | 32K ctx | 48K ctx | KV Cache Size @24K | Gen tok/s | Notes |
|---------|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:------------------:|:---------:|-------|
| **FP16** (default) | ✅ | ⚠️ 10% slow | ❌ deadlock | ~3.8 GiB | 27.2 | Current production |
| **Q8_0** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **2.0 GiB** | 27.3 | Conservative upgrade |
| **Q4_0** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **1.1 GiB** | 27.3 | ← recommended |

**KV cache scaling (Q4_0): ~45 MiB per 1K tokens** (16K=720M, 24K=1.1G, 40K=1.8G).

**Extreme context tests (Q4_0):** Ollama's scheduler auto-sizes KV to what fits in VRAM. With 14.5 GiB available, model weights 8.2 GiB, the maximum KV allocation is **~40K tokens** (1.8 GiB). Requesting larger `num_ctx` is accepted but the runner silently caps and truncates prompts to the actual KV limit.

**Generation speed degrades with context fill (Q4_0, all layers on GPU):**

| Tokens in context | Gen tok/s | Prefill tok/s | Notes |
|:-----------------:|:---------:|:-------------:|-------|
| ~100 (empty) | 27.2 | 58 | Headline number |
| 3,300 | 24.6 | 113 | Typical Signal chat |
| 10,000 | 20.7 | 70 | Long job output |
| 30,000 | **13.4** | 53 | Heavy document analysis |
| 40,960 (max fill) | **~10*** | ~42 | Theoretical, near KV limit |

\* *Estimated from degradation curve. One test at 41K showed 1.2 tok/s, but that was caused by model partial offload (21/41 layers spilled to CPU), not normal operation.*

**Q8_0 ceiling:** Fits up to ~64K context on GPU. At 80K, KV cache spills to CPU (7 tok/s — unusable). Non-deterministic — depends on memory state at load time.

**Not deploying to production.** MoE model (primary) is capped at 16K context — KV quantization provides no benefit (bottleneck is weight size, not KV). Potentially useful for the 9B fallback model at 40K+ context, but not worth the quality risk.
```bash
# If ever needed for 9B model at extreme context:
# Environment=OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q4_0
# in /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d/override.conf
```

> **Current production:** FP16 KV (Ollama default). Context capped at 16K for MoE via `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=16384`.

### 4.5 Prefill (prompt evaluation) benchmarks

On UMA, both prefill and generation share memory bandwidth (~51 GB/s DDR4-3200). Prefill is the time the model spends "reading" the prompt before generating the first token.

> **For embedded engineers:** Think of LLM inference as two phases — like a bootloader and a main loop. **Prefill** is the "bootloader": the model processes the entire input prompt in one burst (parallel, compute-bound — like DMA-ing a firmware image into SRAM). **Token generation** is the "main loop": the model produces output tokens one at a time, sequentially (memory-bandwidth-bound — like polling a UART at a fixed baud rate). MoE (Mixture of Experts) is like having 35 specialized ISRs but only routing to 3 of them per interrupt — you get the routing intelligence of knowing all 35, but only pay the execution cost of 3. That's why a 35B-parameter MoE runs faster than a 14B dense model on hardware without matrix cores.

**Prefill rate vs prompt size — production models (FP16 KV cache, warm):**

**qwen3.5-35b-a3b-iq2m (MoE 35B/3B active, UD-IQ2_M):**

| Prompt Size | Tokens | Prefill | Gen tok/s | TTFT (warm) |
|-------------|:------:|--------:|----------:|------------:|
| Tiny | 17 | 53 tok/s | 39.3 | 0.3s |
| Short | 42 | 68 tok/s | 39.6 | 0.6s |
| Medium | 384 | 231 tok/s | 38.5 | 1.7s |
| Long | 1,179 | 228 tok/s | 38.3 | 5.2s |

**qwen3.5:9b (Q4_K_M, dense 9.7B):**

| Prompt Size | Tokens | Prefill | Gen tok/s | TTFT (warm) |
|-------------|:------:|--------:|----------:|------------:|
| Tiny | 17 | 61 tok/s | 33.2 | 0.3s |
| Short | 42 | 118 tok/s | 33.0 | 0.4s |
| Medium | 384 | 229 tok/s | 33.0 | 1.7s |
| Long | 1,179 | 225 tok/s | 32.5 | 5.2s |

> **Observations:** Both production models converge to ~230 tok/s prefill at medium-to-long prompts — the DDR4 bandwidth ceiling. At tiny prompts (<50 tokens), GPU compute overhead dominates and prefill drops to 53–61 tok/s. Generation rate is stable: MoE holds 38–39 tok/s, 9B holds 32–33 tok/s regardless of prompt size. TTFT scales linearly: at 384 tokens it's ~1.7s, at 1.2K tokens it's ~5.2s. For real-world Signal chat (3K system prompt + conversation), expect TTFT of ~15–20s on cold start, <2s when the model is warm (prompt cached via `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=30m`).

### 4.6 Memory budget

**qwen3.5-35b-a3b-iq2m · headless server (from Ollama logs)**

| Component | MoE @4K ctx | MoE @16K ctx | Notes |
|-----------|:----------:|:------------:|-------|
| Model weights (GPU) | 10.3 GiB | ~8.2 GiB | 41/41 layers on Vulkan0; spills to CPU at higher ctx |
| Model weights (CPU) | 0.3 GiB | ~0.4 GiB | Spilled layers + embeddings |
| KV cache (GPU) | **1.6 GiB** | **~3.8 GiB** | Grows ~0.4 GiB per 1K tokens |
| Compute graph | ~0.2 GiB | ~0.2 GiB | GPU-side |
| **Ollama total** | **12.3 GiB** | **~12.5 GiB** | Ollama dynamically spills weights to make room for KV |
| OS + services | ~0.9 GiB | ~0.9 GiB | Headless Fedora 43 |
| **Free (of 16.5 Vulkan)** | **~4.2 GiB** | **~4.0 GiB** | |
| NVMe swap | 16 GiB | | Safety net |

> **MoE memory dynamics:** As context grows, Ollama intelligently spills weight layers from GPU to CPU to maintain a ~12.5 GiB total. The MoE's total weight (11 GB GGUF) is larger than qwen3:14b (9.3 GB), but only 3B params activate per token — so CPU-spilled layers that aren't selected experts cause zero compute penalty. At 24K+ context, the KV cache exceeds what can fit alongside the weights, causing OOM or timeout.

### 4.7 Model recommendations

**Qwen3.5** is the latest generation — multimodal (vision + tools + thinking), Apache 2.0.

| Use Case | Recommended Model | tok/s | Max Ctx | Why |
|----------|-------------------|:-----:|:-------:|-----|
| **🏆 General AI / primary** | qwen3.5-35b-a3b-iq2m | 38 | 16K | 35B knowledge, 3B active, fastest reasoning |
| **🏆 Long context / vision** | qwen3.5:9b | 32 | **65K** | Multimodal, stable context scaling, vision |
| **Long context (14B)** | phi4:14b | 29 | **40K** | Best 14B model for long context on this hardware |
| **Fast batch jobs** | qwen2.5:7b | 56 | 64K | 2× faster than 14B, 64K context |
| **Code generation** | qwen2.5-coder:7b | 56 | 64K | Same speed as base, code-specialized |
| **Speed-critical** | qwen2.5:3b | 104 | 64K | 4× faster, use for simple tasks |
| **Previous primary** | qwen3:14b (abliterated) | 28 | 24K | Replaced by Qwen3.5 models |

> **Production dual-model config:** `qwen3.5-35b-a3b-iq2m` as primary with `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=16384`. For tasks needing >16K context or vision (image analysis), switch to `qwen3.5:9b` which handles 65K context and can process images.
>
> The MoE wins over the 9B dense model in generation speed (38 vs 32 tok/s) because only 3B parameters activate per token on hardware without matrix cores — fewer multiplications wins. Both models achieve similar prefill rates (~230 tok/s at ~400 tokens), but the 9B wins in context capacity (65K vs 16K) because its smaller total weight leaves more room for KV cache.

```bash
# Primary model (35B MoE) — custom GGUF via Modelfile
# See tmp/Modelfile-qwen35-35b-a3b for setup
ollama create qwen3.5-35b-a3b-iq2m -f Modelfile-qwen35-35b-a3b

# High-context model (vision+65K, official Ollama)
ollama pull qwen3.5:9b

# Context is capped via OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=16384 in systemd (see §3.3, §3.4)
# Individual requests can override with {"options": {"num_ctx": 65536}} when using 9b
```

> **Why not a bigger MoE?** Even though only 3B params activate per token, **all 35B params must reside in memory** — the router decides per-token which experts to fire, so every weight must be loaded. At IQ2_M (~2.5 bits per parameter), 35B = 11 GB GGUF. The next MoE up — Qwen3-235B-A22B — would be ~44 GB at IQ2_M (2.7× too large). Mixtral 8×22B (141B) would be ~35 GB. Going below IQ2_M (e.g. IQ1_S at ~1.5 bits) causes quality collapse. The qwen3.5-35b-a3b at IQ2_M is the **largest MoE that fits 16 GB with usable quantization** on this hardware.

# `PART II` — AI Stack

## 5. Signal Chat Bot

The BC-250 runs a personal AI assistant accessible via Signal messenger — no gateway, no middleware. signal-cli runs as a standalone systemd service exposing a JSON-RPC API, and queue-runner handles all LLM interaction directly.

```
  Signal --> signal-cli (JSON-RPC :8080) --> queue-runner --> Ollama --> GPU (Vulkan)
```

> **Software:** signal-cli v0.13.24 (native binary) · Ollama 0.18+ · queue-runner v7

### 5.1 Why not OpenClaw

OpenClaw was the original gateway (v2026.2.26, Node.js). It was replaced because:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **~700 MB RSS** | On a 16 GB system, that's 4.4% of RAM wasted on a routing layer |
| **15+ second overhead per job** | Agent turn setup, tool resolution, system prompt injection — for every cron job |
| **Unreliable model routing** | Fallback chains and timeout cascades caused 5-min "fetch failed" errors |
| **No subprocess support** | Couldn't run Python/bash scripts directly — had to shell out through the agent |
| **9.6K system prompt** | Couldn't be trimmed below ~4K tokens without breaking tool dispatch |
| **Orphan processes** | signal-cli children survived gateway OOM kills, holding port 8080 |

The replacement: queue-runner talks to signal-cli and Ollama directly via HTTP APIs. Zero middleware.

> See [Appendix A](#appendix-a--openclaw-archive) for the original OpenClaw configuration.

### 5.2 signal-cli service

signal-cli runs as a standalone systemd daemon with JSON-RPC:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/signal-cli.service
[Unit]
Description=signal-cli JSON-RPC daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/opt/signal-cli/bin/signal-cli --output=json \
  -u +<BOT_PHONE> jsonRpc --socket http://127.0.0.1:8080
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Register a separate phone number for the bot via `signal-cli register` or `signal-cli link`.

### 5.3 Chat architecture

Between every queued job, `queue-runner.py` polls the signal-cli journal for incoming messages. Messages are routed based on content type:

```
queue-runner v7 — continuous loop

  job N  →  check Signal inbox  →  route message  →  job N+1
                    |                     |
                    v                     |
            journalctl -u          ┌──────┼──────┐

```

![Signal Pipeline](images/charts/signal-pipeline.png)

**Key parameters:**

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|:-----:|---------|
| `SIGNAL_CHAT_CTX` | 16384 | MoE model context window |
| `VISION_MODEL` | qwen3.5:9b | Vision analysis model (multimodal) |
| `VISION_CTX` | 4096 | Vision context (image tokens are large) |
| `ROUTING_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` | 8000 | Switch to 9B for long prompts |
| `SIGNAL_CHAT_MAX_EXEC` | 3 | Max shell commands per message |
| `SIGNAL_EXEC_TIMEOUT_S` | 30 | Per-command timeout |
| `SIGNAL_MAX_REPLY` | 1800 | Signal message character limit |

### 5.4 Tool use — EXEC

The LLM can request shell commands via `EXEC(command)` in its response. queue-runner intercepts these, runs them, feeds stdout back into the conversation, and lets the LLM synthesize a final answer:

```
  User: "what's the disk usage?"
  LLM:  [thinking...] EXEC(df -h /)
  Runner: executes → feeds output back
  LLM:  "Root is 67% full, 48G free on your 128GB NVMe."
```

Supported patterns: web search (`ddgr`), file reads (`cat`, `head`), system diagnostics (`journalctl`, `systemctl`, `df`, `free`), data queries (`jq` on JSON files). Up to 3 commands per turn.

### 5.5 Image generation via chat

When the LLM detects an image request, it emits `EXEC(/opt/stable-diffusion.cpp/generate-and-send "prompt")`. queue-runner intercepts this pattern and handles it synchronously:

1. Stop Ollama (free GPU VRAM)
2. Run sd-cli with FLUX.2-klein-9B (4 steps, 512×512, ~105s)
3. Send image as Signal attachment
4. Restart Ollama

Bot is offline during generation (~2–3 minutes total including model reload).

**Image editing (Kontext):** Send a photo to Signal with an edit instruction ("make it cyberpunk", "add a hat"). The LLM emits `EXEC(/opt/stable-diffusion.cpp/edit-image "instruction")`, queue-runner runs FLUX.1-Kontext-dev with the photo as reference, and sends back the edited image (~5–10 min @512²). Input images are automatically resized to 512×512. See §6.2 for a demo (Sonic → Shadow the Hedgehog).

**Video generation:** Ask for a video/animation. Uses WAN 2.1 T2V 1.3B (~38 min for 17 frames @480×320).

**ESRGAN upscale:** Every generated image is automatically upscaled 4× with RealESRGAN_x4plus (512²→2048² in ~25s). Both versions sent via Signal — thumbnail + full-res. Also available on-demand via chat.

> ⚠️ **GFX1013 bug:** sd-cli hangs after writing the output image (Vulkan cleanup). queue-runner polls for the file and kills the process.

### 5.6 Personality — "Clawd"

The system prompt defines a cynical, darkly funny personality ("House MD meets a sysadmin lobster"). Key traits:
- Direct, no corporate speak, no disclaimers
- Dark humor about the hardware constraints
- Full access to `/opt/netscan/data/` for grounded answers
- Knows AK's professional context (embedded Linux, camera drivers, V4L2/libcamera)
- Uncensored creative generation (abliterated model, no safety filters)

The personality is baked into `queue-runner.py`'s `SYSTEM_PROMPT` — no external workspace files needed.

### 5.7 Response times

| Scenario | Latency |
|----------|:-------:|
| Text reply (warm) | 10–30s |
| Complex reasoning with tool use | 1–5 min |
| Image generation (FLUX.2-klein-9B 512²) | ~105s |
| Image generation + auto-upscale 4× | ~130s |
| Image editing (Kontext 512²) | ~5 min |
| Video generation (WAN 2.1 480×320) | ~38 min |
| ESRGAN 4× upscale (on-demand) | ~25s |
| Cold start (model reload) | 30–60s |
| Voice note transcription (≤40s) | 3–5s |
| Vision analysis (photo → description) | ~40–80s |

### 5.8 Vision analysis

Send a photo to Signal **without** an edit keyword (no "draw", "generate", "create") and the bot analyzes it using `qwen3.5:9b`'s native multimodal vision. The 9B model processes base64-encoded images via Ollama's `/api/chat` endpoint.

```
  User: [photo of a circuit board] "what chip is this?"
  Router: image + non-edit text → vision analysis (9B)
  9B:    "That's an STM32F407 — the LQFP-100 package, 168 MHz Cortex-M4."
```

**How edit vs. analysis is decided:**

| Input | Keywords detected | Action |
|-------|:-----------------:|--------|
| Photo + "make it cyberpunk" | ✓ edit | → Kontext image editing (§5.5) |
| Photo + "what is this?" | ✗ | → qwen3.5:9b vision analysis |
| Photo (no text) | ✗ | → qwen3.5:9b vision analysis |

**Example — real vision output from the Signal chatbot:**

![Shadow & Marshall on a floppy disk](images/shadow-marshall-floppy.jpg)

This photo was sent to the bot with no text. The `qwen3.5:9b` model produced the following description (lightly edited for formatting):

> This is a charming and nostalgic photo featuring two small figurines placed on a blue 3.5-inch floppy disk, which is resting on a gray outdoor table.
>
> **Figurines:**
> - On the left: a black hedgehog with red stripes on his head and yellow muzzle — **Shadow the Hedgehog** from the *Sonic the Hedgehog* series, standing on a small black circular base.
> - On the right: a white Dalmatian puppy wearing a red firefighter helmet and a yellow collar with a red heart tag — **Marshall** from *PAW Patrol*, sitting upright.
>
> **Floppy Disk:** A classic 3.5-inch disk labeled "2HD 1.44 MB" and "INDEX" (upside down in the image). The label area has horizontal lines like lined paper, adding to the retro aesthetic.
>
> **Background:** A blurred garden with green grass, bushes, and string lights with clear glass bulbs hanging above.
>
> **Overall Vibe:** The combination of modern pop culture characters (Shadow and Marshall) with retro tech (floppy disk) creates a fun, geeky, and slightly whimsical display. It's a great blend of nostalgia and fandom!

This is raw model output from a 9.7B parameter model running entirely on the BC-250's Vulkan GPU — no cloud APIs, no preprocessing. The model correctly identifies both licensed characters, the floppy disk format, and scene composition.

**Key detail:** qwen3.5:9b requires `"think": false` in the API call. With thinking enabled, the model produces only hidden thinking tokens and returns an empty visible response. Discovered via 7 iterative tests (tests 1–6 all returned empty content).

> The MoE model (qwen3.5-35b-a3b-iq2m) has **no vision capability** — it returns HTTP 500 when given images. This is why model routing is essential.

### 5.9 Audio transcription

Send a voice note to Signal and the bot transcribes it using [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) with Vulkan GPU acceleration:

```
  User: [voice note, 15 seconds, Polish]
  Router: audio/* → whisper-cli (auto language detection)
  Whisper: "Hej, sprawdź mi pogodę na jutro" (pl, 15.2s audio)
  Router: → feed transcription to LLM for response
  LLM:   "Jutro 18°C, częściowe zachmurzenie..."
```

**Whisper setup on BC-250:**

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Runtime | whisper.cpp (Vulkan, built from source) |
| Model | ggml-large-v3-turbo (1.6 GB) |
| Binary | `/opt/whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli` |
| Threads | 6 (all Zen 2 cores) |
| Language | Auto-detect (EN/PL confirmed) |

#### Why large-v3-turbo, not large-v3?

Both models were benchmarked with real English TTS speech (flite) at three durations. The speed difference is modest (~2×), but **memory is the dealbreaker** — the larger model doesn't fit alongside Ollama in 16 GB.

**Speed comparison:**

![Whisper Wall Time](images/charts/whisper-wall-time.png)

| Audio | large-v3-turbo | large-v3 | Speedup |
|:-----:|:--------------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| 3.6s | 3.3s | 7.9s | 2.4× |
| 18.2s | 3.5s | 8.9s | 2.6× |
| 39.2s | 4.3s | 8.1s | 1.9× |

**The memory problem:**

The BC-250 has 16 GB total (UMA — shared between CPU and GPU). The Ollama MoE model takes 10.6 GB. OS and buffers need ~3.5 GB. That leaves the memory budget looking like this:

![Whisper Memory Budget](images/charts/whisper-memory-budget.png)

| Scenario | Ollama | Whisper | OS/buffers | Total | Fits 16 GB? |
|----------|:------:|:-------:|:----------:|:-----:|:-----------:|
| Ollama only | 10.6 GB | — | 3.5 GB | 14.1 GB | ✅ 1.9 GB free |
| + large-v3-turbo | 10.6 GB | 1.6 GB | 3.5 GB | 15.7 GB | ✅ 0.3 GB free |
| + large-v3 | 10.6 GB | 2.9 GB | 3.5 GB | 17.0 GB | ❌ 1.0 GB overflow → swap |

When the total exceeds 16 GB, the kernel pushes pages to NVMe swap. This shows up as a measurable swap delta:

![Whisper Memory Impact](images/charts/whisper-memory.png)

large-v3 pushes ~1 GB into swap on first load. large-v3-turbo causes zero swap. Once pages are evicted, subsequent large-v3 runs may show 0 swap delta (the 39s test) because those pages were already swapped out by earlier runs — but the damage (swap pressure, latency spikes) already happened.

**Quality is comparable.** Both models tested on a 39s embedded-systems passage (flite TTS). Both made the same synthesis artifacts ("kilobots" for "kilobytes", "Wipcomer" for "libcamera"). Neither is clearly better on robotic TTS.

**Verdict:** large-v3-turbo — 2× faster, 45% smaller, zero swap pressure. The quality tradeoff is negligible on BC-250's memory budget.

### 5.10 Smart model routing

queue-runner automatically selects the best model for each message based on content:

```python
def choose_chat_model(user_text, has_image=False):
    if has_image:
        return "qwen3.5:9b", 4096       # only model with vision
    if estimate_tokens(user_text) > 8000:
        return "qwen3.5:9b", 16384      # 9B handles 65K context
    return "qwen3.5-35b-a3b-iq2m", 16384  # MoE — faster, smarter
```

![Model Routing Speed](images/charts/model-routing-speed.png)

| Route | Model | Speed | When |
|-------|-------|:-----:|------|
| **Default** | qwen3.5-35b-a3b MoE | 37.7 tok/s | Normal chat (most messages) |
| **Vision** | qwen3.5:9b | 31.8 tok/s | Photo attached (no edit keywords) |
| **Long context** | qwen3.5:9b | 31.8 tok/s | Prompt > 8K tokens |

The MoE activates only 3B of its 35B parameters per token, giving it faster generation than the dense 9B despite being a "larger" model. Both models are Qwen3.5-family and produce comparable text quality for short exchanges. The 9B is reserved for tasks that require vision or long context — capabilities the MoE lacks.

### 6.1 Models

**FLUX.2-klein-9B** — recommended, best quality, Apache 2.0:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/stable-diffusion.cpp/models/flux2 && cd /opt/stable-diffusion.cpp/models/flux2
# Diffusion model (9B, Q4_0, 5.3 GB)
curl -L -O "https://huggingface.co/leejet/FLUX.2-klein-9B-GGUF/resolve/main/flux-2-klein-9b-Q4_0.gguf"
# Qwen3-8B text encoder (Q4_K_M, 4.7 GB)
curl -L -o qwen3-8b-Q4_K_M.gguf "https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf"
# FLUX.2 VAE (321 MB) — different from FLUX.1 VAE!
curl -L -o flux2-vae.safetensors "https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/vae-text-encorder-for-flux-klein-4b/resolve/main/split_files/vae/flux2-vae.safetensors"
```

> Memory: 5.3 GB VRAM (diffusion) + 6.2 GB VRAM (Qwen3-8B encoder) + 95 MB (VAE) = ~11.8 GB total. Stresses the 16.5 GB Vulkan pool properly. Best quality of all tested models.

**FLUX.2-klein-4B** — fast alternative, Apache 2.0:

```bash
cd /opt/stable-diffusion.cpp/models/flux2
# Diffusion model (4B, Q4_0, 2.3 GB)
curl -L -O "https://huggingface.co/leejet/FLUX.2-klein-4B-GGUF/resolve/main/flux-2-klein-4b-Q4_0.gguf"
# Qwen3-4B text encoder (Q4_K_M, 2.4 GB)
curl -L -o qwen3-4b-Q4_K_M.gguf "https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf"
# Reuses same flux2-vae.safetensors from above
```

> Memory: 2.3 GB VRAM (diffusion) + 3.6 GB VRAM (Qwen3-4B encoder) + 95 MB (VAE) = ~6 GB total. 7× faster than 9B but lower quality. Good for quick previews.

**FLUX.1-schnell** — previous default, Apache 2.0:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/stable-diffusion.cpp/models/flux && cd /opt/stable-diffusion.cpp/models/flux
curl -L -O "https://huggingface.co/second-state/FLUX.1-schnell-GGUF/resolve/main/flux1-schnell-q4_k.gguf"
curl -L -O "https://huggingface.co/second-state/FLUX.1-schnell-GGUF/resolve/main/ae.safetensors"
curl -L -O "https://huggingface.co/second-state/FLUX.1-schnell-GGUF/resolve/main/clip_l.safetensors"
curl -L -O "https://huggingface.co/city96/t5-v1_1-xxl-encoder-gguf/resolve/main/t5-v1_1-xxl-encoder-Q4_K_M.gguf"
```

> Memory: 6.5 GB VRAM (diffusion) + 2.9 GB RAM (T5-XXL Q4_K_M) = ~10 GB total.

**Chroma flash Q4_0** — alternative, open-source:

```bash
cd /opt/stable-diffusion.cpp/models/flux
curl -L -o chroma-unlocked-v47-flash-Q4_0.gguf "https://huggingface.co/leejet/Chroma-GGUF/resolve/main/chroma-unlocked-v47-flash-Q4_0.gguf"
# Reuses existing T5-XXL and FLUX.1 ae.safetensors from above
```

> Memory: 5.1 GB VRAM (diffusion) + 3.2 GB RAM (T5-XXL) = ~8.4 GB total.

**SD-Turbo** — fast fallback, lower quality:

```bash
cd /opt/stable-diffusion.cpp/models
curl -L -o sd-turbo.safetensors \
  "https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-turbo/resolve/main/sd_turbo.safetensors"
```

### 6.2 Performance

*Benchmarked 2026-03-14, sd.cpp master-525-d6dd6d7, Vulkan GFX1013 (16.5 GiB), Ollama stopped.*

> **Important:** FLUX GGUF files must use `--diffusion-model` flag, not `-m`. The `-m` flag fails with "get sd version from file failed" because GGUF metadata is empty after tensor name conversion. This applies to all sd.cpp versions.

**🏆 FLUX.2-klein-9B Q4_0 — new default (best quality):**

| Resolution | Steps | Time | s/step | Notes |
|:----------:|:-----:|:----:|:------:|-------|
| 512×512 | 4 | **104s** | 15.4 | Default, ~11.8 GB VRAM total |
| 768×768 | 4 | **129s** | 21.3 | Best balance of quality vs time |

> FLUX.2-klein-9B uses a Qwen3-8B LLM as text encoder — richer prompt understanding and finer detail than the 4B variant. Stresses the 16.5 GB Vulkan pool properly (11.8 GB used). The `--offload-to-cpu` flag is essential (manages UMA allocation pools).

**FLUX.2-klein-4B Q4_0 — fast alternative:**

| Resolution | Steps | Time | s/step | Notes |
|:----------:|:-----:|:----:|:------:|-------|
| 512×512 | 4 | **20s** | 3.95 | Fast preview, ~6 GB VRAM total |
| 512×512 | 8 | **26s** | 2.66 | Better quality, GPU warm |
| 768×768 | 4 | **30s** | 5.43 | Great quality, no tiling |
| 1024×1024 | 4 | **63s** | 10.18 | VAE tiling required |
| 1024×1024 | 4 | ❌ FAIL | — | Without `--vae-tiling` (VAE OOM) |

> 7× faster than 9B but noticeably less detailed. Good for quick previews or batch generation.

**FLUX.1-schnell Q4_K — previous default:**

| Resolution | Steps | Time | Notes |
|:----------:|:-----:|:----:|-------|
| 512×512 | 4 | **30s** | ~10 GB VRAM (6.5 diffusion + 3.4 encoders) |
| 768×768 | 4 | **91s** | VAE tiling kicks in |
| 1024×1024 | 4 | **146s** | VAE tiling, good quality |
| 512×512 | 8 | **77s** | More steps, marginal improvement |

**Chroma flash Q4_0 — quality alternative (reuses T5+VAE from FLUX.1):**

| Resolution | Steps | Time | Notes |
|:----------:|:-----:|:----:|-------|
| 512×512 | 4 | **85s** | Sampling 46s + encoder 37s |
| 512×512 | 8 | **130s** | Sampling 96s |
| 768×768 | 8 | **240s** | Sampling 195s |

> Chroma uses cfg-based guidance (like FLUX.1-dev) but is fully open. Quality is better than schnell per step, but 4× slower than FLUX.2-klein.

**FLUX.1-dev Q4_K_S — high-quality, slow (city96/FLUX.1-dev-gguf, 6.8 GB):**

| Resolution | Steps | Time | Notes |
|:----------:|:-----:|:----:|-------|
| 512×512 | 20 | **279s** | Sampling 253s (12.65 s/step), ~6.6 GB VRAM |
| 768×768 | 20 | ❌ FAIL | Guidance model compute graph exceeds VRAM |

**SD-Turbo — fast fallback:**

| Resolution | Steps | Time | Notes |
|:----------:|:-----:|:----:|-------|
| 512×512 | 1 | **11s** | Minimum viable, ~2 GB VRAM |
| 768×768 | 4 | **21s** | Decent for quick previews |

**Head-to-head comparison (same prompt, same hardware, back-to-back):**

| Model | 512² @4s | 768² @4s | VRAM | Diffusion | Encoder |
|-------|:--------:|:--------:|:----:|:---------:|:-------:|
| **FLUX.2-klein-9B** | **104s** | **129s** | **11.8 GB** | 5.3 GB | Qwen3-8B (4.7 GB) |
| FLUX.2-klein-4B | 20s | 30s | 6 GB | 2.3 GB | Qwen3-4B (2.4 GB) |
| FLUX.1-schnell | 30s | 91s | 10 GB | 6.5 GB | CLIP+T5 (3.4 GB) |
| Chroma flash | 85s | 240s⁸ | 8.4 GB | 5.1 GB | T5 (3.2 GB) |
| FLUX.1-dev | 279s²⁰ | ❌ | 10 GB | 6.8 GB | CLIP+T5 (3.4 GB) |
| SD-Turbo | 11s¹ | 21s | 2 GB | 2 GB | (built-in) |

> FLUX.2-klein-9B is the quality winner — more detail, better text understanding, and it actually stresses the 16.5 GB GPU properly (11.8 GB used vs 6 GB for 4B). The 4B version is 7× faster but leaves 10 GB unused.

**🔬 Quality shootout — same prompt, same seed (42), 512×512 @4 steps:**

All models tested back-to-back on the same prompt: *"a cyberpunk cityscape at sunset with neon lights reflecting on wet streets, highly detailed"*

| Model | Time | s/step | VRAM | File Size | Quality |
|-------|:----:|:------:|:----:|:---------:|:-------:|
| **FLUX.2-klein-9B** | **104s** | 15.4 | 11.8 GB | 709 KB | **★★★★** — finest detail, best reflections |
| FLUX.2-klein-4B | 15s | 2.7 | 6.0 GB | 704 KB | ★★★ — good but less detail |
| FLUX.1-schnell | 31s | 6.5 | 10.1 GB | 609 KB | ★★ — decent, less coherent |
| Chroma flash (8 steps) | 120s | 14.1 | 8.4 GB | 204 KB | ★★ — artistic but softer |

**Example outputs** (same prompt, same seed 42, 512×512):

| FLUX.2-klein-9B (★★★★) | FLUX.2-klein-4B (★★★) |
|:-:|:-:|
| ![9B](images/shootout/shootout-9b-512.png) | ![4B](images/shootout/shootout-4b-512.png) |
| **104s**, 11.8 GB VRAM | **15s**, 6.0 GB VRAM |

| FLUX.1-schnell (★★) | Chroma flash (★★) |
|:-:|:-:|
| ![schnell](images/shootout/shootout-schnell-512.png) | ![chroma](images/shootout/shootout-chroma-512.png) |
| **31s**, 10.1 GB VRAM | **120s**, 8.4 GB VRAM |

> The 9B model produces visibly more detail in fine structures (neon reflections, wet streets, building facades). The 4B is the speed champion but sacrifices detail. Chroma has a distinctive artistic style but outputs smaller, softer images. FLUX.1-schnell sits in the middle.

**Summary: recommended settings for production**

| Use case | Model | Resolution | Steps | Time |
|----------|-------|:----------:|:-----:|:----:|
| **Default (Signal)** | **FLUX.2-klein-9B** | **512×512** | **4** | **~105s** |

### 6.2.1 Upgrade roadmap — beyond the current stack

sd.cpp (master-525+) supports more models. The BC-250 has ~16.5 GB with Ollama stopped (post-GTT migration). All models use `--offload-to-cpu` (UMA — no PCIe penalty).

**Image generation — tested models:**

| Model | Params | GGUF Size | Total RAM¹ | Steps | Quality | Status |
|-------|:------:|:---------:|:----------:|:-----:|:-------:|--------|
| **FLUX.2-klein-9B Q4_0** | **9B** | **5.3 GB** | **~11.8 GB** | **4** | **★★★★** | **✅ Current default, 104s @512²** |
| FLUX.2-klein-4B Q4_0 | 4B | 2.3 GB | ~6 GB | 4 | ★★★ | ✅ Fast alternative, 20s @512² |
| FLUX.1-schnell Q4_K | 12B | 6.5 GB | ~10 GB | 4 | ★★ | ✅ Previous default, 30s @512² |
| Chroma flash Q4_0 | 12B | 5.1 GB | ~8.4 GB | 4–8 | ★★★ | ✅ Tested — 85s @512², better quality |
| FLUX.1-dev Q4_K_S | 12B | 6.8 GB | ~10 GB | 20 | ★★★★ | ✅ Tested — 279s @512², ❌768²+ |
| SD-Turbo | 1.1B | ~2 GB | ~2.5 GB | 1–4 | ★ | ✅ Fast preview, 11s @512² |
| SD3.5-medium Q4_0 | 2.5B | 1.7 GB | ~6 GB | 28 | ★★★ | ✅ Tested — 49s @512², needs clip_g+clip_l+T5+F16 VAE³ |

> ¹ Total RAM includes diffusion model + text encoder(s) + VAE.

**Video generation — tested models:**

| Model | Params | GGUF Size | Total RAM¹ | Frames | Time | Status |
|-------|:------:|:---------:|:----------:|:------:|:----:|--------|
| **WAN 2.1 T2V 1.3B Q4_0** | **1.3B** | **826 MB** | **~5 GB** | **17 @480×320** | **~38 min** | **✅ Works on BC-250** |

> WAN requires umt5-xxl text encoder (3.5 GB Q4_K_M) + WAN VAE (243 MB). Outputs raw AVI (MJPEG). No matrix cores = slow but works.

**Video generation — tested (OOM):**

| Model | Params | GGUF Size | Total RAM¹ | Notes |
|-------|:------:|:---------:|:----------:|-------|
| WAN 2.2 TI2V 5B Q4_0 | 5B | 2.9 GB | **~9 GB** | **❌ OOM crash at Q4_0.** Model (2.9G) + VAE (1.4G) + T5 (4.7G) = 9 GB — exceeds UMA budget during video denoising. May work with Q2_K model + Q2_K T5 (~6 GB) but untested. |

**Image editing — FLUX.1-Kontext-dev:**

| Model | Params | GGUF Size | Total RAM¹ | Status |
|-------|:------:|:---------:|:----------:|--------|
| FLUX.1-Kontext-dev Q4_0 | 12B | 6.8 GB | ~10 GB | ✅ Tested — 316s @512² (no swap). 1024² causes swap pressure (40+ min). Uses `-r` flag, reuses FLUX.1 T5/CLIP/VAE |

> Kontext is a dedicated image editing model by Black Forest Labs. It takes a reference image via `-r` and a text instruction to produce an edited version. Uses existing FLUX.1 encoders (T5-XXL, CLIP_L) and VAE (ae.safetensors) from `/opt/stable-diffusion.cpp/models/flux/`.
> ```bash
> # Edit an existing image with Kontext:
> sd-cli --diffusion-model models/flux/flux1-kontext-dev-Q4_0.gguf \
>   --vae models/flux/ae.safetensors --clip_l models/flux/clip_l.safetensors \

>   -r input.png -p "change the sky to sunset" --cfg-scale 3.5 --steps 28 \
>   --sampling-method euler --offload-to-cpu --diffusion-fa -o output.png
> ```

**Kontext demo — "turn Sonic into Shadow the Hedgehog":**

| Input (1200×1600 → resized to 512×512) | Output (512×512, 647s) | Output + ESRGAN 4× (2048×2048, +25s) |

| ![Kontext input](images/kontext/kontext-input.jpg) | ![Kontext output](images/kontext/kontext-output.png) | ![Kontext 4×](images/kontext/kontext-output-4x.png) |

> The 4× upscaled version (right) is generated automatically by the ESRGAN auto-upscale pipeline — every generated/edited image gets a 2048×2048 version sent alongside the 512×512 original. Total overhead: ~25s with tile 192. See ESRGAN benchmarks below.

#### SD3.5-medium benchmark details

**Timing breakdown (512×512, 28 steps, seed 42):**

```

> **⚠ BF16 VAE gotcha:** The upstream SD3 VAE (`diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors`) uses BF16 tensors. GFX1013 Vulkan has no BF16 support — the output is a solid blue/yellow rectangle. Fix: convert to F16 with `python3 convert_vae_bf16_to_f16.py input.safetensors output.safetensors` (script in `/tmp/`).

# WAN 2.1 text-to-video generation:

```

> **Output format:** sd.cpp produces raw AVI (MJPEG) regardless of the `-o` extension. The 17-frame clip plays at 16 fps (~1 second). Quality is recognizable but noisy — expected at Q4_0 with scalar-only Vulkan compute.
>
> **Why so slow?** Each video frame is a full diffusion pass through the 1.3B model. With 17 frames × 50 steps × no matrix cores, every multiply is scalar. A GPU with tensor/matrix units (RDNA3+, Turing+) would be 5–10× faster.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/wan-test.gif" alt="WAN 2.1 T2V — cat in garden" width="480">
</p>

> 17 frames @480×320, 50 steps, Q4_0 quantization, EUR scheduler, cfg-scale 6.0. Generated in **~38 minutes** on GFX1013 scalar Vulkan — no matrix/tensor cores. The BC-250 rendered every frame through pure ALU compute. Noisy but recognizable — a real video from a 1.3B parameter model on a secondhand BC-250.

#### ESRGAN 4× upscale benchmarks

All generated images are automatically upscaled with RealESRGAN_x4plus (64 MB model, 4× scaling). Runs immediately after generation while Ollama is still stopped — zero extra GPU-swap cost.

**ESRGAN tile size benchmark (512² input → 2048² output):**

| Tile Size | Time | Output | Notes |
|:---------:|:----:|:------:|-------|
| 128 (default) | **15s** | 2048×2048, 5.1 MB | Fastest, visible seams possible |
| **192 (production)** | **25s** | 2048×2048, 5.1 MB | **Best quality/speed tradeoff** |
| 256 | **41s** | 2048×2048, 5.1 MB | Smoothest seams, 2.7× slower |
| 128 ×2 passes (16×!) | **4m 50s** | **8192×8192, 67 MB** | 512²→8192² in under 5 min |

> Production uses tile 192: larger tiles mean fewer seam boundaries → cleaner upscale. The 16× mode (two ESRGAN passes) produces **67-megapixel images from 512² input** — available on-demand via `EXEC(upscale ...)` but not automatic (too large for Signal).

# `PART III` — Monitoring & Intelligence

## 7. Netscan Ecosystem

A research, monitoring, and data collection system with **330 autonomous jobs** running on a GPU-constrained single-board computer. Dashboard at `http://<LAN_IP>:8888` — 29 main pages + 101 per-host detail pages.

### 7.1 Architecture — queue-runner v7

The BC-250 has 16 GB GTT shared with the CPU — only **one LLM job can run at a time**. `queue-runner.py` (systemd service) orchestrates all 330 jobs in a continuous loop, with Signal chat between every job:

```
queue-runner v7 -- Continuous Loop + Signal Chat

Cycle N:
  330 jobs sequential, ordered by category:
  scrape -> infra -> lore -> academic -> repo -> company -> career
         -> think -> csi -> meta -> market -> report
  HA observations interleaved every 50 jobs
  Signal inbox checked between EVERY job
  Chat processed with LLM (EXEC tool use + image gen)
  Crash recovery: resumes from last completed job

Cycle N+1:
  Immediately starts -- no pause, no idle windows
  No nightly/daytime distinction
```

**Key design decisions (v5 → v7):**

| v5 (OpenClaw era) | v7 (current) |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Nightly batch + daytime fill | Continuous loop, no distinction |
| 354 jobs (including duplicates) | 330 jobs (deduped, expanded) |
| LLM jobs routed through `openclaw cron run` | All jobs run as direct subprocesses |
| Signal via OpenClaw gateway (~700 MB) | signal-cli standalone (~100 MB) |
| Chat only when gateway available | Chat between every job |
| Async SD pipeline (worker scripts, 45s delay) | Synchronous SD (stop Ollama → generate → restart) |
| GPU idle detection for user chat preemption | No preemption needed — chat is interleaved |

**All jobs run as direct subprocesses** — `subprocess.Popen` for Python/bash scripts, no LLM agent routing. This is 3–10× faster than the old `openclaw cron run` path and eliminates the gateway dependency entirely.

### 7.1.1 Queue ordering

The queue prioritizes **data diversity** — all dashboard tabs get fresh data even if the cycle is interrupted. See §7.3 for the full category breakdown with GPU times. HA observations are interleaved every 50 jobs, and Signal chat is checked between every job.

### 7.1.2 GPU idle detection

GPU idle detection is used for legacy `--daytime` mode and Ollama health checks:

```python
# Three-tier detection:
# 1. Ollama /api/ps → no models loaded → definitely idle
# 2. sysfs pp_dpm_sclk → clock < 1200 MHz → model loaded but not computing
# 3. Ollama expires_at → model about to unload → idle for 3+ min
```

In continuous loop mode (default), GPU detection is only used for pre-flight health checks — not for yielding to user chat, since chat is interleaved between jobs.

### 7.6 GPU monitoring — 3-state

Per-minute sampling via `pp_dpm_sclk`:

| State | Clock | Temp | Meaning |
|-------|:-----:|:----:|---------|
| `generating` | 2000 MHz | ~77°C | Active LLM inference |
| `loaded` | 1000 MHz | ~56°C | Model in VRAM, idle |
| `idle` | 1000 MHz | <50°C | No model loaded |

### 7.7 Configuration & state files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `profile.json` | Public interests — tracked repos, keywords, technologies |
| `profile-private.json` | Career context — target companies, salary expectations *(gitignored)* |
| `watchlist.json` | Auto-evolving interest tracker |
| `digest-feeds.json` | Mailing list feed URLs (8 feeds from lore.kernel.org) |
| `repo-feeds.json` | Repository API endpoints |
| `sensor-watchlist.json` | CSI camera sensor tracking list |
| `queue-runner-state.json` | Cycle count, resume index *(in data/)* |
| `/opt/netscan/data/jobs.json` | All 330 job definitions |

### 7.8 Resilience

| Mechanism | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Systemd watchdog** | `WatchdogSec=14400` (4h) — queue-runner pings every 30s during job execution |
| **Crash recovery** | State file records nightly batch progress; on restart, resumes from last completed job |
| **Midnight crossing** | Resume index valid for both today and yesterday's date (batch starts 23:00 day N, may crash after midnight day N+1) |
| **Atomic state writes** | Write to `.tmp` file, `fsync()`, then `rename()` — survives SIGABRT/power loss |
| **Ollama health checks** | Pre-flight check before each job; exponential backoff wait if unhealthy |
| **Network down** | Detects network loss, waits with backoff up to 10min |
| **GPU deadlock protection** | If GPU busy for > 60min continuously, breaks and moves on |
| **OOM protection** | Ollama `OOMScoreAdjust=-1000`, 16 GB NVMe swap, zram limited to 2 GB |
| **Signal delivery** | `--best-effort-deliver` flag — delivery failures don't mark job as failed |

## 8. Career Intelligence

Automated career opportunity scanner with a two-phase anti-hallucination architecture.

### 8.1 Two-phase design

```
  HTML page
    +-> Phase 1: extract jobs (NO candidate profile) -> raw job list
                                                            |
  Candidate Profile + single job ---------------------------+
    +-> Phase 2: score match -> repeat per job
                                   +-> aggregate -> JSON + Signal alerts
```

**Phase 1** extracts jobs from raw HTML without seeing the candidate profile — prevents the LLM from inventing matching jobs. **Phase 2** scores each job individually against the profile.

### 8.2 Alert thresholds

| Category | Score | Alert? |
|----------|:-----:|:------:|
| ⚡ Hot match | ≥70% | ✅ (up to 5/scan) |
| 🌍 Worth checking | 55–69% + remote | ✅ (up to 2/scan) |
| Good / Weak | <55% | Dashboard only |

> Software houses (SII, GlobalLogic, Sysgo…) appear on the dashboard but **never trigger alerts**.

### 8.3 Salary tracker · `salary-tracker.py`

Nightly at 01:30. Sources: career-scan extraction, NoFluffJobs API, JustJoinIT, Bulldogjob. Tracks embedded Linux / camera driver compensation in Poland. 180-day rolling history.

Nightly at 01:50. Deep-dives into 43 tracked companies across 8 sources: GoWork.pl reviews, DuckDuckGo news, Layoffs.fyi, company pages, 4programmers.net, Reddit, SemiWiki, Hacker News. LLM-scored sentiment (-5 to +5) with cross-company synthesis.

> **GoWork.pl:** New Next.js SPA breaks scrapers. Scanner uses the old `/opinie_czytaj,{entity_id}` URLs (still server-rendered).

### 8.5 Patent watch · `patent-watch.py`

Nightly at 02:10. Monitors 6 search queries (MIPI CSI, IR/RGB dual camera, ISP pipeline, automotive ADAS, sensor fusion, V4L2/libcamera) across Google Patents, EPO OPS, and DuckDuckGo. Scored by relevance keywords × watched assignee bonus.

### 8.6 Event scout · `event-scout.py`

Nightly at 02:30. Discovers tech events with geographic scoring (local 10, nearby 8, Poland 5, Europe 3, Online 9). Sources: Crossweb.pl, Konfeo, Meetup, Eventbrite, DDG, 14 known conference sites.

## 10. Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>▸ ROCm crashes in Ollama logs</b></summary>

Expected — Ollama tries ROCm, it crashes on GFX1013, falls back to Vulkan. No action needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>▸ Only 7.9 GiB GPU memory instead of 14 GiB</b></summary>

GTT tuning not applied. Check: `cat /sys/module/ttm/parameters/pages_limit` (should be 4194304). See §3.3.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>▸ 14B model loads but inference returns HTTP 500</b></summary>

TTM pages_limit bottleneck. Fix: `echo 4194304 | sudo tee /sys/module/ttm/parameters/pages_limit` (see §3.3).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>▸ Model loads on CPU instead of GPU</b></summary>

Check `OLLAMA_VULKAN=1`: `sudo systemctl show ollama | grep Environment`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>▸ Context window OOM kills (the biggest gotcha on 16 GB)</b></summary>

Ollama allocates KV cache based on `num_ctx`. Many models default to 32K–40K context, which on a 14B Q4_K model means 14–16 GB *just for the model* — leaving nothing for the OS.

**Symptoms:** Gateway gets OOM-killed, Ollama journal shows 500 errors, `dmesg` shows `oom-kill`.

**Root cause:** The abliterated Qwen3 14B declares `num_ctx 40960` → 16 GB total model memory.

**Fix:** Create a custom model with context baked in:
```bash
cat > /tmp/Modelfile.16k << 'EOF'
FROM huihui_ai/qwen3-abliterated:14b
PARAMETER num_ctx 16384
EOF
ollama create qwen3-14b-16k -f /tmp/Modelfile.16k
```

This drops memory from ~16 GB → ~11.1 GB. Do **not** rely on `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH` — it doesn't reliably override API requests from the gateway.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>▸ signal-cli not responding on port 8080</b></summary>

Check the service: `systemctl status signal-cli`. If it crashed, restart: `sudo systemctl restart signal-cli`. Verify JSON-RPC:
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/rpc \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"listAccounts","id":"1"}'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>▸ zram competing with model for physical RAM</b></summary>

Fedora defaults to ~8 GB zram. zram compresses pages but stores them in *physical* RAM — directly competing with the model. On 16 GB systems running 14B models, disable or limit zram and use NVMe file swap instead:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf.d
echo -e '[zram0]\nzram-size = 2048' | sudo tee /etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf.d/small.conf
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>▸ Python cron scripts produce no output</b></summary>

Stdout is fully buffered under cron (no TTY). Add at script start:
```python
sys.stdout.reconfigure(line_buffering=True)
sys.stderr.reconfigure(line_buffering=True)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>▸ Signal delivery from signal-cli</b></summary>

Signal JSON-RPC API at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/rpc`:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/rpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"send","params":{
    "account":"+<BOT>","recipient":["+<YOU>"],
    "message":"test"
  },"id":"1"}'
```

</details>

## 11. Known Limitations

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Shared VRAM | Image gen requires stopping Ollama. Bot offline ~2–3 min (FLUX.2-klein-9B) or ~1 min (FLUX.2-klein-4B). |
| MoE context limit | 35B-A3B MoE tops out at 16K context (weights = 10.3 GiB, KV fills rest). Use 9B for >16K. |
| Signal latency | Messages queue during job execution (typical job 2–15 min). Chat checked between every job. |
| sd-cli hangs on GFX1013 | Vulkan cleanup bug → poll + kill workaround. |
| Cold start latency | 30–60s after Ollama restart (model loading). |
| Chinese thinking leak | Qwen3 occasionally outputs Chinese reasoning. Cosmetic. |
| Prefill rate degrades with context | 128 tok/s at 1.3K → 70 tok/s at 10K tokens (UMA bandwidth + attention scaling). |
| Gen speed degrades with context fill | 27 tok/s empty → 13 tok/s at 30K tokens. Partial model offload at KV limit causes cliff drop. |
| Ollama caps KV auto-size at ~40K (Q4_0) | `num_ctx` > 40960 accepted but silently truncated. Actual limit = VRAM ÷ per-token KV size. |
| Speculative decoding blocked | Ollama 0.18 has no `--draft-model`. Dual-model loading evicts the draft model. |
| TTS not feasible | CPU-based TTS (Piper, Coqui) competes with GPU for the same 16 GB UMA pool. No Vulkan TTS exists. |

## Appendix A — OpenClaw Archive

<details>
<summary><b>▸ Historical: OpenClaw gateway configuration (replaced in v7)</b></summary>

OpenClaw v2026.2.26 was used as the Signal ↔ Ollama gateway from project inception through queue-runner v6. It was a Node.js daemon that managed signal-cli as a child process, routed messages to the LLM, and provided an agent framework with tool dispatch.

**Why it was replaced:**
- ~700 MB RSS on a 16 GB system (4.4% of total RAM)
- 15+ second overhead per agent turn (system prompt injection, tool resolution)
- Unreliable fallback chains caused "fetch failed" timeout cascades
- Could not run scripts as direct subprocesses — everything went through the LLM agent
- signal-cli children survived gateway OOM kills, holding port 8080 as orphans
- 9.6K system prompt that couldn't be reduced below ~4K without breaking tools

**What replaced it:** See §5 for the current architecture.

The gateway service (`openclaw-gateway.service`) ran as a user-level systemd unit. It has been disabled and masked:

```bash
systemctl --user disable --now openclaw-gateway
systemctl --user mask openclaw-gateway
```
